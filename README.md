# SOC Internship Project – Task 2

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my internship in the **Security Operations Center (SOC)** domain.  
The task involved simulating SOC analyst activities, including log monitoring, alert analysis, and drafting an **Incident Response Report**.

The goal was to analyze Linux and Windows logs, identify suspicious activities, classify alerts based on severity, and simulate the incident response process using SIEM concepts.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor and analyze Linux & Windows logs.  
- Identify malicious events such as:  
  - Failed logins  
  - Malware detections  
  - Unauthorized connections and file access  
- Classify alerts by severity (High, Medium, Low).  
- Prepare a professional **Incident Response Report**.  
- Maintain clear documentation for reproducibility.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk (Free Trial)** – For SIEM log analysis and visualization.  
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)** – Alternative SIEM environment.  
- **Sample Logs** – Linux & Windows system, authentication, and malware detection logs.  
- **Google Docs / Word** – For incident reporting.
